    These Terms of Service constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity ("you") and OpenTask ("we", "us", or "our"), concerning your access to and use of the [opentask.app](https://opentask.app) website (the "Services").

    You agree that by accessing the Services, you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the following Terms of Service, including our [Privacy Policy](https://opentask.app/privacy) (together, these "Terms"). If you are not eligible or do not agree to the Terms, you are expressly prohibited from using the Services and must discontinue use immediately. Your use of the Services and OpenTask's provision of the Services to you constitutes an agreement by OpenTask and by you to be bound by these Terms.

    **Arbitration NOTICE**. Except for certain kinds of disputes described in the "Dispute resolution and arbitration" section, you agree that disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration, and by accepting these terms, you and OpenTask waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in any class action or representative proceeding.

    ### Disclaimer

    THE SERVICES AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND ON AN "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. OPENTASK DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE SERVICES AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES, INCLUDING (A) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; AND (B) ANY WARRANTY ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE. OPENTASK DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES OR ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE, OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH OR PROCESSED BY THE SERVICES, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND OPENTASK DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICES OR OPENTASK ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OPENTASK ENTITIES OR THE SERVICES THAT ARE NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY DISCLAIMER IN THESE TERMS, WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM (A) THE SERVICES; (B) THE ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OF USERS THAT YOU INVITE TO THE SERVICES; (C) YOUR ABILITY OR INABILITY TO ACCESS, EXPORT, TRANSFER, RETRIEVE, OR REMOVE ANY USER CONTENT FROM ANY PROJETCS OR TASKS; (C) THE PROCESSING OR USE OF YOUR USER CONTENT BY AN ORGANIZATION; AND (D) YOUR DEALING WITH ANY OTHER SERVICE USER, ADMINISTRATOR, OR ORGANIZATION. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICES AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES) OR ANY LOSS, USE, OR DISCLOSURE OF DATA, INCLUDING USER CONTENT. THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS, AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

    OpenTask does not disclaim any warranty or other right that OpenTask is prohibited from disclaiming under applicable law.

    ### Limitation of Liability

    TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE OPENTASK ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON OR AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY OPENTASK ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.

    ### Dispute resolution and arbitration

    **1. Generally.**

    In resolving disputes between you and OpenTask most expediently and cost-effectively, subject to all applicable laws except as described in **2. Exceptions** and **3. Opt-Out** below, you and OpenTask agree that every dispute arising with these Terms and your use of the Services will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to minimal review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms or your use of the Service, whether based on contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND OPENTASK WAIVES TO THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. If you reside in a country (for example, a member state of the European Union) with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, this Section (Dispute resolution and arbitration) does not affect those requirements.

    **2. Exceptions**

    Despite the provisions of Section **"1. Generally"**, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

    **3. Opt-Out**

    If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section (Dispute resolution and arbitration) within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending an email to opentaskapp@gmail.com that specifies:

    - Your full legal name.
    - The email address associated with your account on the Services.
    - A statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (**"Opt-Out Notice"**).
      Once OpenTask receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section (Dispute resolution and arbitration) will be void, and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as outlined in Section **Governing Law** below. Your Opt-Out Notice will not affect the remaining provisions of these Terms.

    **4. Arbitrator**

    Any arbitration between you and OpenTask will be settled under the law of Brazil and administered by the "Centro Brasileiro de Mediação e Arbitragem" ("CBMA"), under its Arbitration Rules (collectively, "CBMA Rules") as modified by these Terms. The CBMA Rules are available online at [cbma.com.br](https://cbma.com.br) or by calling the CBMA at +55 21 2233 9974. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to this binding arbitration agreement's interpretation, applicability, or enforceability.

    **5. No class actions**

    YOU AND OPENTASK AGREES THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and OpenTask agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

    **6. Modifications to this arbitration provision**

    If OpenTask makes any future change to this arbitration provision, you may reject the change by mailing us a notice within 30 days of the change to opentaskapp@gmail.com, in which case your account with OpenTask will be immediately terminated, and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately before the changes you rejected will survive.

    **7. Enforceability**

    If Section **5. No class actions** or the entirety of this Section (Dispute resolution and arbitration) is found to be unenforceable, or if OpenTask receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section (Dispute resolution and arbitration) will be null and void and, in that case, exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section **Governing Law** will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.

    ### Governing law

    These Terms are governed by the laws of Brazil and the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil, without regard to conflict of law principles. You and OpenTask submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Florianópolis, Santa Catarina, to resolve any lawsuit or court proceeding permitted under these Terms. In addition, please note that disputes may be submitted for online resolution to the European Commission Online Dispute Resolution platform (visit [ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr) for more information).

    ### Miscellaneous

    The Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and OpenTask regarding your use of the Services. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not impact the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms, "including" means "including but not limited to". If any part of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.

    Your use of the Services is subject to all additional terms, policies, rules, or guidelines applicable to the Services or certain features of the Services that we may post on or link to from the Services. All additional terms are incorporated by this reference into and made a part of these Terms.

    We are under no obligation to provide support for the Services. In instances where we may offer support, the support will be subject to published policies.

    Access to the Services from countries or territories or by individuals where such access is illegal is prohibited.

    ### Corrections

    Information on the Services may contain typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions, including descriptions, pricing, availability, and other information. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions and to change or update the information on the Services at any time without prior notice.
