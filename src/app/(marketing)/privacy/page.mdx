      This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.

      ### How do we use your personal information?

      We use your information to provide you with the Services, to improve and monitor the Services, to allow you to log in to your account, to communicate with you, and to comply with the law.

      ### How we use cookies and similar technologies

      We use cookies to collect information about your browsing activities and to distinguish you from other users of our Services, allowing us to provide you with the best functionality of our Services.

      We also use Google Analytics as our third-party analytics provider to help us understand how users engage with the Services. You can opt out of Google Analytics without affecting how you visit our Website by going to [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) or via Google's Ads settings.

      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

But we may retain information for backups, abuse prevention, analytics, or satisfaction of legal obligations for up to 90 days or as long as the law requires.

      You have the right to receive a copy of your information that we process in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format or to request that such information is transferred to a third party.

      You have the right to correct any Information held about you that is inaccurate.
