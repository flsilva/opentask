    #### Sensitive information

    We do not process sensitive information.

    #### Payment information

    All services provided by OpenTask are free. We do not provide any paid services, so we do not process any payment information.

Still, it may include device and usage information, including your IP address, browser, operating system, location, and how and when you use our Services, among other technical details. We also use cookies and similar technologies to enhance your experience using the Services.

    This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.

    ### How do we use your personal information?

    We use your information to provide you with the Services, to improve and monitor the Services, to allow you to log in to your account, to communicate with you, and to comply with the law.

    ### How we use cookies and similar technologies

    We use cookies to collect information about your browsing activities and to distinguish you from other users of our Services, allowing us to provide you with the best functionality of our Services.

    We also use Google Analytics as our third-party analytics provider to help us understand how users engage with the Services. You can opt out of Google Analytics without affecting how you visit our Website by going to [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) or via Google's Ads settings.

    ### Who do we share your personal information with?

    - Law enforcement agencies, public authorities, or other judicial bodies and organizations. We disclose the information if we are legally required to do so or if we have a good faith belief that such use is reasonably necessary to comply with a legal obligation, process, or request; enforce our terms of service and other agreements, policies, and standards, including investigation of any potential violation thereof; detect, prevent or otherwise address security, fraud or technical issues; or protect the rights, property or safety of us, our users, a third party or the public as required or permitted by law (including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection).

    ### How long do we keep your information?

    We will only keep your personal information for as long as necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a more extended retention period is required or permitted by law.

    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

    You can delete your account at any time by visiting the "Settings" page: Sign in, then click on the "Person" icon at the top right corner of the page, then click "Settings". In the "Settings" page, you can see instructions on how to delete your account. When you delete your account, your personal information, projects, and tasks will be immediately deleted from our production database. But we may retain information for backups, abuse prevention, analytics, or satisfaction of legal obligations for up to 90 days or as long as the law requires.

    You have the right to receive a copy of your information that we process in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format or to request that such information is transferred to a third party.

    You have the right to correct any Information held about you that is inaccurate.

    You have the right, in certain circumstances, to stop us from processing information other than for storage purposes.

    You have the right to complain to a supervisory authority in your country of residence, place of work, or where an incident occurred.
